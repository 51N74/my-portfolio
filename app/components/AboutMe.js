          I graduated from KMUTT with a degree in IT and have been working in
          the IT field for 2-3 years. My career began as a UX/UI Designer, where
          I designed websites using Figma based on client requirements. Although
          I enjoyed the creative process, I realized it wasn't my true passion.

          During the COVID-19 pandemic, I pursued a different path by opening my
          own specialty coffee shop, "Alongdrip Coffee," in Khao Yai. This
          experience was transformative, teaching me invaluable skills in
          business management, time scheduling, cost control, and even coffee
          roasting. It was a hands-on opportunity to manage a small business and
          create a unique customer experience.

          After the pandemic, I returned to the IT field, starting with
          foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I currently work as
          a WordPress Developer at an agency, where I focus on designing and
          customizing websites based on client needs. My role involves CSS
          development, theme customization, and occasional plugin modifications
          using PHP.

          In addition to my professional work, I have diverse experience from
          previous roles. As a Film Developer and Sales Associate at a film
          camera shop, I provided customer support by recommending film and
          camera options, developing and scanning film, and ensuring an
          excellent customer experience. This role further honed my time
          management and task prioritization skills.

          Developer. My current learning journey includes exploring frameworks
          like React and Next.js, as well as backend technologies like Node.js
          and Python. Passionate about web development, I embrace new challenges
